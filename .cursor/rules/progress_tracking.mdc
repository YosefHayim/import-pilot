# Progress Tracking Protocol (MANDATORY)

## Critical Requirement

**Update `progress-project.md` after EVERY task completion.**

This file is the **single source of truth** for project state and context. Updates are mandatory - no exceptions.

## Workflow

### Before Starting Work

1. Read `progress-project.md` to understand current state
2. Check "In Progress" section to avoid duplicate work
3. Update "In Progress" with what you're starting

### After Completing Work

1. Update "Completed Work" with date and task description
2. Update "Current Features" if new feature added
3. Clear task from "In Progress" section
4. Update "Session Notes" for context handoff
5. Update other sections as applicable

## Update Format

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD

- [x] Task description - Brief implementation notes
- [x] Another task - Relevant context or details
```

## Sections to Update

| Section | When | What |
|---------|------|------|
| Completed Work | After every task | Date, description, notes |
| Current Features | New feature done | Name, status, description |
| In Progress | Start/end work | Task, date, agent |
| Technical Decisions | Arch choices | Decision, rationale |
| Known Issues | Bugs found | Issue, severity, status |
| Session Notes | End of session | Context for next session |

## Enforcement

- This is NOT optional
- No task is too small
- When in doubt, update
- See `AGENTS.md` for full protocol
