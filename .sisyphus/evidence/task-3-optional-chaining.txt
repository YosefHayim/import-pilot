TASK 3: Fix GitHub Issue #78 - Optional Chaining False Positives
================================================================

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
Optional chaining (`obj?.method()`) was incorrectly capturing `method` as a standalone used identifier.
This caused false positives in the import detection system.

FIX APPLIED:
============
File: src/parser/astParser.ts (line 100)

BEFORE:
  const functionCallRegex = /(?<![.\w])([a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*)\s*\(/g;

AFTER:
  const functionCallRegex = /(?<![.?\w])([a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*)\s*\(/g;

CHANGE: Added `?` to the negative lookbehind character class
- The `?` character in the lookbehind means: "don't match if preceded by `.`, `?`, or a word character"
- This excludes `obj?.method()` because `method` is preceded by `?`
- Maintains existing behavior for `obj.method()` (still excluded)
- Maintains existing behavior for bare `method()` calls (still captured)

TESTS ADDED:
============
File: src/__tests__/astParser.test.ts

New test suite: "FIX #78: optional chaining should not capture method as identifier"

1. Test: "should not capture method in optional chaining obj?.method()"
   - Verifies that `method` is NOT captured when preceded by `?.`
   - PASS ✓

2. Test: "should still not capture method in dot notation obj.method() (regression guard)"
   - Verifies that `method` is still NOT captured when preceded by `.`
   - Ensures the fix doesn't break existing behavior
   - PASS ✓

3. Test: "should still capture bare function call method() (regression guard)"
   - Verifies that `method` IS captured when called without a prefix
   - Ensures the fix doesn't break bare function call detection
   - PASS ✓

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
====================
✓ TypeScript type check: npx tsc --noEmit → 0 errors
✓ astParser tests: 19 tests PASS (including 3 new tests)
✓ Full test suite: 508 tests PASS (up from 505)
  - Test Suites: 14 passed, 14 total
  - Tests: 508 passed, 508 total
