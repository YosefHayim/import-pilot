# Discovered Patterns

> **AI-logged patterns** discovered during development.
> Review periodically and promote important patterns to `.ai/patterns/`.

---

## How This Works

1. **AI agents add patterns** they discover while working
2. **You review** periodically (weekly/sprint)
3. **Promote to patterns/** if used 3+ times
4. **Archive** outdated patterns

---

## Pattern Template

When logging a new pattern, use this format:

```markdown
### {{DATE}} - {{PATTERN_NAME}}

**Context**: Where/how this pattern was discovered

**Pattern**:
```code
// Example code showing the pattern
```

**Why**: Why this pattern is important or better than alternatives

**Used in**:
- `path/to/file1.ts`
- `path/to/file2.ts`

**Status**: New | Validated | Promoted | Archived
```

## Review Checklist

When reviewing patterns:

- [ ] Is this pattern used in 3+ places?
- [ ] Does it prevent bugs or save time?
- [ ] Should it be promoted to `patterns/`?
- [ ] Is it still relevant to current codebase?
- [ ] Does it conflict with any standards?
